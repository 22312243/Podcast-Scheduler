# Podcast-Scheduler-Publisher
This is a project i developed for my Object-Oriented Programming course. It manages the lifecycle of podcast episodes from creation and scheduling to publishing using a clean, layered architecture.

### Tech Stack
Java,JavaFX, Maven, UML Class Diagrams for architecture planning.

I focused on **layered architecture** to keep my code organized

- **layer for core data** like: Episode, BonusEpisode, EpisodeStatus.
- **UI layer**: manage the JavaFX logic and the main application launch.
- **OOP Principles**: I used Interfaces(Publishable) and Inheritance to handle each episode behaviors.

### Key Features
* **Interactive GUI**: Developed with JavaFX for scheduling and publishing episodes.
* **Data Persistence**: Includes a "Save All" feature to store episode data.
